    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      My jouney at the moment is seeking experience in computer programming and to
      utilized the knowledge of programming language. Passion is making art through programming and photography.
      My strength relies as following:
      <ul>
        <li><a>Excellent Computer fundamentals of logic, programming, and literacy skills</a></li>
        <li><a>Ability to learn new technologies rapidly, successful working in team or self-directed setting</a></li>
        <li><a>Excellent in object-oriented programming; developing, testing and debugging code; designing interfaces</a></li>
        <li><a>Creative in making art that other people won't imagion/a></li>
        <li><a>Love feeding my brain knowledge, which to me it's a brain fertilizer</a></li>
      </ul>
</p>
<p>Growing up, the Steve Job and Bill Gates had been a great inspiration to me. The following line stated from Paul King, a web software entrepreneur that answered "How good were Bill Gates and the late Steve Jobs at programming?". </p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.quora.com/How-good-were-Bill-Gates-and-the-late-Steve-Jobs-at-programming-1">
  Paul repies:
  <br>
  Bill Gates' reputation is that he was an excellent coder in his day, and technically astute and incisive throughout his time
  leading Microsoft. In college (at Harvard), Bill Gates and Paul Allen wrote a full BASIC language interpreter in assembly language
  for a computer they didn't even have access to and which had only 4000 bytes of memory. They wrote it on a PDP-10 at Harvard that
  was running an Intel 8080 emulator. Bill Gates once said that he remembered every technical detail and variable name of those early
   programs, although surely that would not be true today.
<br>
Steve Jobs was never a programmer. He was a product visionary, astute businessman, and excellent if eccentric salesman. It was Steve
Wozniak who built the Apple I while Steve promoted it. That said (from my experience working at his company NeXT), Steve had an
amazing knack for understanding technical concepts and how they could be relevant. While he had never programmed, his technical
people convinced him of the revolutionary power of object-oriented programming. As a result, he made object-oriented design the
central theme of the NeXT machine and he developed a great sales pitch for its ability to reduce code bulk: "The line of code you
don't write is the line of code you never have to debug."
</blockquote>

<p> From reading that, everyday I push my self to become better one step at a time just like them. They once was in the same forstep as me.</p>
